# Kinetic Monte Carlo v 0.0.1
The English Wiki page is a pretty good place to learn most of the important intro stuff for KMC

## Usage
The files in the examples/ folder showcase how to use this library

## Development
This is a passion project of mine that I develop on and off and use in my day to day research. Any and all PRs, comments, and ideas are welcome

## How to help / contribute
I still have no idea how to test this thing, having good tests that can make sure new code does not break the engine would be a gamechanger
